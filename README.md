- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @annieco29
- ğŸ‘€ I am a data scientist based in Chicago, IL.
- ğŸ”¥ My focus is in end-to-end data science pipelines, and using machine learning models from scikit-learn and other libraries to predict human behavior and churn.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to get better at tuning hyper-parameters, spin up front-end visualizations of my data science projects in Streamit, and use PyTorch to train deep learning models.
